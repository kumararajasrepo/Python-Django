		The report should include the following information:

		1. The location and property type
		2. The average price and square footage
		3. The average number of bedrooms and bathrooms
		4. The report should be saved to a PDF file

To complete this task, need to install below Python libraries:

1. pandas for data manipulation 
2. NumPy for numerical computations
3. reportlab for generating PDF files

Need to have a good understanding of Python's file I/O operations and data structures.
